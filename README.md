# 1 About the package
This package describes the workflow of how to download file data from Encode and how to map IDs to HGNC IDs.

The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) is a public research project whose purpose it to identify functional elements in the human genome. Right now it has extended to other organisms like mouse and fly.
It analyzed data in integrative fashion. Registry of candidate regulatory elements is one of the most important annotations in the integrative level.
One achievement from this project shows that some "useless" elements in genomes are not as useless as we thought before.
we can look at the enhancer region part and use Yufei's GTRD data to annotate the specific TFs that bind there, and identify co-regulated genes.
